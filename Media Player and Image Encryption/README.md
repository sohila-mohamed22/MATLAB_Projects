# üéµ Media Player and Image Encryption using MATLAB GUI

This project combines a **media player** with image manipulation capabilities, including **image encryption**. The tool is implemented using MATLAB's **GUIDE** framework, offering a user-friendly graphical interface to manage audio files and perform basic image processing and encryption.

---

## üìã Project Overview

The **Media Player and Image Encryption GUI** provides:
- A **media player** to play, pause, and stop audio files.
- Image manipulation features, including:
  - Converting images to grayscale.
  - Converting images to black-and-white (binary).
  - Applying **salt-and-pepper noise encryption**.

This GUI is perfect for beginners learning MATLAB GUI programming or for those looking to explore media and image processing concepts.

## üñ•Ô∏è Interface Overview

### GUI Layout

The GUI consists of the following sections:

1. **Media Player Section**:
   - **Audio Buttons**: Buttons to load and control playback of audio files.
   - **Original and Encrypted Playback Options**: Toggle between original and encrypted audio.
   - **Audio Control Dropdowns**: Controls for playing, pausing, and stopping both the original and encrypted audio.

2. **Image Processing Section**:
   - **Image Buttons**: Buttons to load images, view the original, convert to grayscale, and apply salt-and-pepper encryption.
   - **Image Display Area**: The GUI displays images in different stages (original, grayscale, binary, encrypted) based on user selections.

3. **Display Axes**:
   - **Original Image**: Shows the loaded image.
   - **Grayscale Image**: Displays the image in grayscale.
   - **Binary Image**: Displays the image in black-and-white (binary).
   - **Encrypted Image**: Displays the image with salt-and-pepper noise encryption.

The image shows the GUI interface with:
- **Audio control** at the top for playing and managing audio files.
- **Image controls** on the left side for loading and processing images.
- **Display areas** at the bottom to show the images in different processing stages (original, grayscale, binary, encrypted).

**Note:** Replace the `path/to/your/gui_screenshot.png` with the actual path to a screenshot of your GUI if you wish to provide a visual of the interface.
