## 🛠️ Features

- **Graphical Interface**: Easy-to-use GUI with separate input fields and buttons for each operation.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (−)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
- **Real-Time Results**: Displays results immediately after performing an operation.
- **Error-Free Input Handling**: Input fields automatically convert text to numeric values, ensuring seamless user experience.
